.panel[.panel-name[LAND]
.pull-left[
-	_Changes in vegetation_ - **biospheric stress**, such as pollution, drought, or temperature extremes- predict and prevent wildfire danger or crop failure

-	_Changes in land cover type_ > deforestation, grassland converting to cropland, burned land returning  to natural vegetation

-	_Modelling carbon cycle_ > check increase in greenhouse gas (Carbon dioxide) > contributing to **global warming**

-	_Type of vegetation_, soil composition and temperature> **mass and energy exchange**
]

.pull-right[
-	_Global photosynthesis and productivity_> **Carbon source** and **Carbon sink** 
  -	Effects of diminishing carbon sinks
  -	Effects of land use changes
  -	Land surface temperature rise effects on frozen artic soils
-	_Role of snow cover and sea ice_ in climate change.
-	_Effects of global temperature_ increases on snow and sea ice’s thermal regulation of the planet

.panel[.panel-name[OCEAN]

.pull-left[
-	Data > global maps of ocean color _(reflected by concentration of organisms in surface water- phytoplankton)_- measurements of chlorophyll and other pigments
  -**Why?**Phytoplanktons (biomass) > phytoplankton productivity > **carbon fixation** >> Earth’s Largest Carbon sink!! 
  
- _Sea surface temperature (SST)_- **rate of exchange** between the ocean and the atmosphere
  - Earth’s habitability
  - Potent Greenhouse gas (water vapor)
  - climate change
  -	cloud formation, inc.thunderstorms and hurricanes
  
- Understand and predict long term **climate changes** and short term **Climate events** (eg:El Niño)

-	Better understanding of _cause-and-effect relation_ (Feedback loops) by understanding cloud properties

- Weekly and monthly cloud-cleared products > used in _global change models_

- _Aerosols detection_ (Dust, sea salt, volcanic emissions, smoke from forest fires, and some kinds of pollution) 
  - atmospheric heating > alter global air circulation and rainfall patterns
  
- _Understanding relationships_ between clouds, precipitation, and aerosols> modelling and predicting consequence- global change.

Issue of Manmade Aerosols
- Small
- Numerous

Clouds containing many man made aerosols
- smaller liquid droplets 
- brighter than clouds with larger droplets
  - reflect more solar radiation back to space
  - cooling effect 
  
**But!**
  
- Small droplets evaporate faster
- More clouds but less rain

[(Kraatz, Khanbilvardi and Romanov, 2016)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165232X16301999)
.pull-left[
- Purpose: River Ice Monitoring
- Study area:Susquehanna River, US
- Dataset and processing:MODIS 
  - Data date: 2014, additional: 2002 & 2003
  - visual Comparison data (CRIOS-CREST River Ice Observing System-MODIS:band1&2 ) date:2002 to 2012 
  - Aqua reflectance product MYD09GA
]

.pull-right[
- Bands: 4 _(visible band)_ & 7 _(SWIR)_- to discriminate clouds from snow. _if need be -bands 6 & 7- differentiate b/w land and snow/ snow covered land_
  + Observation Geometry
  - grid cell: 0.5km
  - cloud flag _(STATE_QA bit 0–1)_
  - Additional source of validation: Landsat 8
- Other data: discharge data, discharge quality, in situ air temperature,flood observation data
- MODIS cloud mask- bands 5 _(supplement flase color images- highlight location of snow cover and clouds)_,4 and 7

###Example of studies  
[(Doraiswamy et al., 2005)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425705001355)

.pull-left[
- Purpose:Crop Yield assessment 
- Desired output: retrival of crop biophysical parameters, integrated in crop yield simulation models & potential of MODIS 250m
- Location:McLean County, Illinois, USA, 2000
- crops- corn and soyabean
- classification of study area:NASS using Landsat TM images
  - Bands: all+ thermal (2 scenes- 25th Apr 2000 and 31st Aug 2000)
- MOD12: not used- as it does not differentiate differnt crops
- MODIS 250m investigated- its footprint over Landsat TM Classification

.pull-right[

- MODIS Based classification- Bands 1& 2(8 day-five (DOY 113, 145, 169, 201, 233))
  - Based on quality assessment and minimum cloud cover
- Crop yield simulation- crop season data(daily average temperature, solar radiation and rainfall data)
  - Conducted: by data layers (daily average temp, solar radiation and rainfall)
  - grid: 1.6 × 1.6 km2 (because- standard grid for road network and landuse in the U.S. Midwest is 1.4 × 1.4 km2)
- MODIS derived LAI profile was used to modify the crop model simulation of crop emergence
- LAI and yield simulations (run separately- corn & soybean)
